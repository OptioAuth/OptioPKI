# Encrypt the intermediate key with AES 256-bit encryption and a strong password.
#
# Use the private key to create a certificate signing request (CSR). 
# The CSR details donâ€™t need to match the intermediate CA. 
#
# For client certificates, the Common Name must be a fully qualified domain name (eg, example.com), 
# whereas for client certificates it can be any unique identifier (eg, an e-mail address). 
#
# Note that the Common Name cannot be the same as either your root or intermediate certificate.
#
#
# For client certificates, 
# it might be useful (and required for latest browsers) to provide subjectAltName (SAN) extension, 
# so that the certificate will be valid (besides the Common Name) for other host names too. 
#
# Use -addext switch to provide them (openssl 1.1.1 is needed) as shown in the example below. 
# For older versions of openssl, SAN can be specified by creating a new section (for example alt_names) 
# in client/client_openssl.cnf file and reference it in client_cert section.
#
# The index.txt file is where OpenSSL ca tool stores the certificate database. 
# Do not delete or edit this file by hand. 
# It should now contain a line that refers to the intermediate certificate.
