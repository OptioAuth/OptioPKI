# When an application (eg, a web browser) tries to verify a certificate signed by the intermediate CA, 
# it must also verify the intermediate certificate against the root certificate. 
# To complete the chain of trust, create a CA certificate chain to present to the application.
#
# To create the CA certificate chain, concatenate the intermediate and root certificates together. 
# We will use this file later to verify certificates signed by the intermediate CA.
#
# Our certificate chain file must include the root certificate because no client application knows 
# about it yet. A better option, particularly if youâ€™re administrating an intranet, 
# is to install your root certificate on every client that needs to connect. 
# In that case, the chain file need only contain your intermediate certificate.
